        <p>I live in Te Awamutu with my Mum and Dad, Ailsing and Kyle, my brothers, Darragh and OÃ­sin and our dog, Flynn. My Mum is Irish and half of my family lives in Ireland. We're going to see them in March this year, because we haven't been in over 5 years and my Aunty is getting Married. My Dad and the rest of my family are from and live in New Zealand. My brothers go to St Patrick's Catholic School in Te Awamutu, which is also where I went before St John's. My Brother Darragh will be coming to St John's next year, which I am no looking forward to. My dog Flynn is an English Springer Spaniel, he's very relaxed and never barks.</p>
