        <p>I have a good friend group here at St John's but the only reason I added this page is because my friend Boyd was at my house when I was making it and insisted on being included in my website. I met Boyd at St Pat's when we were 5 years old, we've been friends ever since. He goes to St John's aswell.</p>
